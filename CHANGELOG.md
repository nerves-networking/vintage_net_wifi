# Changelog

## v0.9.0

* New features
  * Initial support for 802.11s mesh networking. Please see the docs and the

    configuration than normal WiFi options.
  * Synchronize with vintage_net v0.9.0's networking program path API update

## v0.8.0

* New features
  * Add a WiFi signal strength polling feature. This works when connected to a
    WiFi access point.
  * Support vintage_net v0.8.0's `required_ifnames` API update

## v0.7.0

Initial `vintage_net_wifi` release. See the [`vintage_net v0.7.0` release
notes](https://github.com/nerves-networking/vintage_net/releases/tag/v0.7.0)
